# footballScoreBoard

README file for the recruitment job

The project was made in Java 11 + Gradle + Spock (for application testing)
Gradle and Spock were selected on the basis of development experience - in the current company we use these solutions so I'm the most fluid in them.

I tried to use the cleanest Java possible without additional frameworks, e.g. Lombok. Also on purpose I did not use generic classes as the prjoket was supposed to be simple.

The project has been divided into modules similar to the hexagonal architecture. 
Unfortunately, due to a rather large simplification, there was no room to show off here.

Application tests cover all its functionality described in the task.

The JAR file has been generated and is located in the main project folder - file name: footballScoreBoard.main.jar.

I am open to meet and discuss the task.
